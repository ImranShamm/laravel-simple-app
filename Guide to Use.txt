Pre-Requisite: You need to install Laravel on your machine


To install the laravel application into your localhost server,
Assuming you have the link to the application in Github.com

1. IF you are using Visual Studio Code, on your keyboard press CTRL+SHIFT+P
   Clone the link "https://github.com/ImranShamm/laravel-simple-app"

2. IF you are download the application file in Zip, extract it in your localhost directory. (Assuming the directory is in www), and extract it.

3. Create new database inside your local, give it any name you wanted

4. Change the DB_DATABASE based on your database given in previous step inside .ENV file.
   I did not push any .ENV file, create new file in the main directory, and give the name .ENV
   but you can copy the .ENV.EXAMPLE contents and change it there

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE= your_database_here
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

5. Change the mail environment to use the forgot password, it will be sent to your mailtrap. Assuming you already have the mailtrap account
Go to the mailtrap inbox, in the SMTP Settings tab, in the integration drop down, select Laravel 7+

MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME= (it will be provided in mailtrap)
MAIL_PASSWORD= (it will be provided in mailtrap)
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS= (your email)
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"

//Assuming you are already managed to run the application on your browser.
//IF THERE IS ANY ERROR WHILE LAUNCHING THE APPLICATION, RUN THIS COMMAND [to update the environment]
 composer update


6. Run the following command to migrate all the tables inside your database->
   php artisan migrate

7. Go the homepage and click Register on the top right of the page.

8. Login with the  credentials

9. Play around, you can make a simple CRUD in this simple application.
